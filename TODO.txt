- need to handle death respawn scenario transition
- need to handle end of wave transition
- need to handle end of game transition
- need sounds for explosions
- need sounds for bomb launch

- allow missiles to destroy bombs
- for every 1000 points, get a bonus life


when all aliens killed
    allow explosions to clear - wait 1s
    display "Wave #" for 1s
    start next wave
    does this need to be a game state change? Maybe restart the game play state?
